## 📌 Project Overview

* **Dataset:** Bengaluru house price dataset (commonly available on Kaggle).
* **Goal:** Build a machine learning model to predict housing prices.
* **Techniques Used:**

  * Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  * Feature Engineering
  * Outlier Detection
  * Model Training & Evaluation

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
* Scikit-learn for machine learning models
* Jupyter Notebook for development

## 🚀 Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**

   * Understanding the dataset, missing values, and structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Feature engineering (converting categorical data, handling dimensionality)
   * Removing outliers
3. **Model Building**

   * Train-test split
   * Linear Regression & other models
   * Cross-validation
4. **Model Evaluation**

   * Performance metrics (R² score, accuracy)
   * Comparing models

---

## 📊 Results

* Successfully built a regression model to predict Bengaluru house prices.
* The model provides fairly accurate predictions after cleaning data and handling outliers.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Deploy the model using Flask / FastAPI.
* Create an interactive web app using Streamlit.
* Try advanced models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
